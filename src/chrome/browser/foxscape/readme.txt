Details
=======

If, like myself, you are a long time user of the Netscape Communicator 4.x
series of browsers, which in the context of appearances includes Netscape 6+
using the "Classic" theme, Mozilla Suite M18+, and SeaMonkey 1.x using the
"Classic" theme (all herein referred to simply as Netscape), then you should
love this theme!  If not, then this theme will probably do nothing for you.


In spite of similarities to the following five Firefox themes, none of the
graphic elements in FOXSCAPE come from them.

I extracted the bulk of the graphic elements directly from the files in
Netscape (version 4.8) and a few from other sources.


I would like to send thanks to the authors (~digiboy, lost, and Nick
Kriukov) of those other themes that inspired me to create and maintain
FOXSCAPE.


My vision of what a Netscape theme should be is different from others.
I wanted to create a full featured theme which uses as many of the original
graphic elements as possible and, in the case where there are no appropriate
graphic elements to use with new features, create new graphic elements that
mimic the old style as closely as possible.  Additionally, I wanted to
subtly improve the original graphic elements that had small defects which
bothered me while I used Netscape.  I feel that I have achieved that goal.
So, in my opinion, FOXSCAPE provides an experience which is even better
than the original. I hope you feel the same too.


As suggested on the Mozilla web site, I used the default theme in Firefox
as a foundation to build upon.  In doing so, I replaced nearly all of the
default image files with Netscape styled ones.  However, I did not change
several images which are mostly unimportant due to their rare use or
rather non-themed appearance.  There are also some image elements that
are used in conjunction with the Location bar, Search bar, and Tab Bar
which are shaded, giving a subtle 3D look.  These elements are left
unchanged by default since I feel that they look reasonably nice as is
and I feel that some people might not like the flat look.  For those who
wish to make these items look flat, see the Advanced Customization
section.


With all of the aforementioned in mind,  you can see that I am not a
purist with respect to making this theme totally match the Netscape look
and feel.  If you feel you can do better, then have at it!  You can take
what I have done here and improve it to your liking.  All I ask is that
you give me (Michael Walden) and FOXSCAPE a bit of credit in your
creation.  Also, please let me know about your creation so I can check it
out.  Thanks in advance.

Enjoy!


Features and Points
===================

- Small, medium, large and extra large Netscape throbbers are included.
- The throbber frame rate is adjusted to approximate Netscape's rate.
- The size of the throbber icon is selected automatically based upon the
  type and size setting of the toolbar icons and, in the case of the
  Menu Bar, the bar on which the throbber is positioned.
- Surprisingly, the large and extra large throbbers do not waste space in the
  vertical direction when used on a toolbar that has other buttons on it.
- Cleaned up the overall appearance of the classic Netscape icons.
- Improved the glint of light / plus sign graphic used in several icons.
- Created several new icons: Go, New Tab, New Window, History, Tab Bar Close,
  Tab Bar Left Arrow, Tab Bar Right Arrow, Full Screen and more.
- RSS feeds are indicated by orange bookmark folders.
- The toolbar bookmarks use the same icon ('N' in a rectangle) as Netscape
  (on windows) does, which differs from the icon (green bookmark) used on
  links elsewhere.
- Toolbar button text labels display in bright blue and dark blue during mouse
  hover and mouse click, respectively.

Installation
============

Install from Add-ons web page method:

1. On the FOXSCAPE Firefox Add-ons web page, click "+ Add to Firefox"
2. Click "Add to Firefox" on the popup.
3. Click "Install Now" on the Software Installation window.
4. Click "Restart Now" when it appears.


Downloaded .xpi method:

1. On the FOXSCAPE Firefox Add-ons web page, right click on
   "+ Add to Firefox", click "Save Link As...", choose a folder, and
   click Save to download the .xpi file to your computer.
2. In Firefox, go to Tools > Add-ons > Appearance.
3. Drag and drop the .xpi file into Add-ons Manager window.
4. Click "Install Now" on the Software Installation window.
5. Click "Restart Now" when it appears.


Customization - Position the throbber
=====================================

After restarting, you should do the following two steps.


1. Open the Customize Toolbar window - Right click on the home button and
   choose Customize... on the popup menu that appears.  Alternatively, you
   can get there using the menu bar by clicking View > Toolbars >
   Customize... .


2. Relocate the Activity Indicator (a.k.a Throbber) - Assuming that your
   installation of Firefox is fresh, the Throbber will be located in the
   Customize Toolbar window.  If needed, drag the throbber from it's current
   position and drop it on the right hand side of the Navigation toolbar (to
   the right of the search control).  If after moving the Throbber you are
   satisfied with the layout of the browser then you can just click on the
   Done button and you are finished.  If you would like to make things look
   as close as possible to one of the supported browser families (Netscape
   4.x, Netscape 6.x, Mozilla M18+, SeaMonkey 1.0+), then continue on to the
   following section.


Customization - Netscape 4.x Toolbar Layout
===========================================

If you wish to make your Firefox browser look like the Netscape 4.x family of
browsers, do the following steps.  Otherwise, go to the following section.

1. Make a Location Toolbar - In the Customize Toolbar window, click on Add New
   Toolbar, enter Location Toolbar as the name, and click OK to continue.  You
   will see a new blank toolbar appear below the Navigation toolbar and above
   the Bookmarks toolbar.  Drag the existing Location bar and Search bar from
   the Navigation toolbar and place them on the new Location toolbar so they
   appear in the following left to right order.

   Location Toolbar
   ----------------
   1. Bookmarks Menu   [Fx4] (Appears with a dropmark symbol (down pointing
                             triangle) on the right of the folder)
   2. Location
   3. Search
   4. Subscribe        [Fx4]

   [Fx4] = New additions to Firefox 4.0.  The bookmarks menu button
           existed in Netscape 4.x, but not in any subsequent Mozilla
           release, until Firefox 4.0.  The subscribe button was in
           Firefox 3.6 in the Location bar, but not as a separate
           toolbar button.  The subscribe button is optional here, and
           may be alternatively positioned on the navigation toolbar as
           described below.
           

2. Customize the Navigation Toolbar - Now that the Location bar and Search
   bar are not taking up space on the Navigation toolbar, drag and drop
   controls as needed to produce a Navigation toolbar control layout that
   matches the following left to right layout order.  Note that items seven
   through 24 were not available in Netscape 4.x.  They are presented here
   in an order that makes logical sense (to me, at least), and as they may
   have been arranged in a hypothetical evolution of Netscape 4.x that
   gained functionality.  They are optional, and may be left out if you
   wish to adhere to a more classic look.

   Navigation Toolbar
   ------------------
   01. Back     \__ One control
   02. Forward  /
   03. Reload
   04. Home
   05. Print
   06. Stop
   07. - Separator -
   08. New Tab         (Appears as a + symbol on right end of tab bar)
   09. List all tabs   [Fx4] (Appears as a dropmark symbol (down pointing
                             triangle) on right end of tab bar)
   10. Tab Groups      [Fx4]
   11. New Window
   12. Full Screen
   13. Zoom Controls   [Fx4]
   14. - Separator -
   15. Downloads
   16. Bookmarks
   17. History
   18. - Separator -
   19. Cut
   20. Copy
   21. Paste
   22. - Separator -
   24. Sync            [Fx4]
   23. Subscribe       [Fx4]
   25. [Flexible Space]
   26. Activity Indicator (Throbber)

   [Fx4] = New additions to Firefox 4.0+.  List all tabs and Subscribe were
           in Firefox 3.6, but not as navigation toolbar buttons.

   Be sure to position a Flexible Space (25 above) item on the left hand side
   of the Throbber to make the Throbber always appear at the far right end of
   the Navigation toolbar if the browser window size is expanded.


3. Icon Text - The final important step is to make the icons display their
   corresponding text labels by selecting Icons and Text in the Show: drop
   down selector located in the lower left corner of the Customize Toolbar
   window.  Also note that the Use Small Icons checkbox should be unchecked
   to produce the large icons typically seen in Netscape.  When you are
   finished customizing the layout, click Done to finish unless you want to
   do the following optional step.


4. Simulate Grippies - This optional step allows you to change the
   toolbars to approximate the appearance of toolbar grippies, though they
   will not function.  Simply drag two Separator items to the left end of
   the following bars: Menu Bar, Navigation Toolbar, Location Toolbar,
   and the Bookmarks Toolbar.  Click Done to finish.


Customization - Netscape 6-7.x, Mozilla M18+, SeaMonkey 1.0+ Toolbar Layout
===========================================================================

If you wish to make your Firefox browser look like one of the following
browser families: Netscape 6-7.x, Mozilla Milestone 18 to 1.7.x, or
SeaMonkey 1.0 to 2.x, then do the following steps.  Otherwise, go to the
following section.


1. Customize the Navigation Toolbar - With the Customize Toolbar window
   open, Drag and drop controls as needed to produce a Navigation toolbar
   control layout that matches the following left to right layout order.

   Navigation Toolbar
   ------------------
   1. Back
   2. Forward
   3. Reload
   4. Stop
   5. Location
   6. Search
   7. Print
   8. Activity Indicator (Throbber)

   Lastly, if you are trying to make Firefox look like one of the browser
   families other than Netscape 6.x, be sure to read to the section titled
   "Included throbbers" to see how to make the throbber look like the one
   from the browser family you desire.


2. Customize the Bookmarks Toolbar - Drag and drop controls as needed to
   produce a Bookmarks toolbar control layout that matches the following
   left to right layout order.

   Bookmarks Toolbar
   -----------------
   1. Home
   2. Bookmarks Toolbar Items


3. Icon Text - The final important step is to make the icons display their
   corresponding text labels by selecting Icons and Text in the Show: drop
   down selector located in the lower left corner of the Customize Toolbar
   window.  Also note that the Use Small Icons checkbox should be unchecked
   to produce the large icons typically seen in browsers.  When you are
   finished customizing the layout, click Done to finish unless you want to
   do the following optional step.


4. Simulate Grippies - This optional step allows you to change the
   toolbars to approximate the appearance of toolbar grippies, though they
   will not function.  Simply drag two Separator items to the left end of
   the following bars: Menu Bar, Navigation Toolbar, and the Bookmarks
   Toolbar.  Click Done to finish.


Advanced Customization
======================

Further customization of FOXSCAPE can be accomplished through use of
subskins.  Subskins are portions of a theme that are not enabled by
default.  They can optionally be enabled by the user.

I have included two subskin templates which will allow you to easily
pick and choose subskin features to be enable.  This is done by simply
un-commenting lines to enable their associated subskins.  The templates
can be seen by entering the following address into the address bar:

 chrome://browser/skin/config

Copy each template text block from the page above and paste each one into
the file specified in the comments at the top of each text block.  Be
sure to place the text blocks at the specified position (top or bottom)
in each file.

Now you can un-comment lines in the copied templates to enable their
associated subskins.  For example, in the userChrome.css file, you can
enable the modern keyhole style back and forward buttons subskin by
changing the following line:

/* @import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Enable_keyhole_back_and_forward_buttons.css"); */

to it's un-commented form:

   @import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Enable_keyhole_back_and_forward_buttons.css"); 

After saving your changes, restart Firefox to make the changes active.
Now you should see the modern keyhole style back and forward buttons.

I tried to name each subskin in a way that would clearly describe the
function it performs.  The subskin name is capitalized in the sample line
below to illustrate where it occurs on each template line:

/* @import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/SUBSKIN-NAME.CSS"); */

Experiment by un-commenting one line at a time to learn what each subskin
does.

Note: Starting in FOXSCAPE version 3.03 I relocated all base theme .css
file changes to separate subskins.  These separate subskins are exposed
as entries in the 0-config-template.css file ( accessed by going to
chrome://browser/skin/config ) and are the default subskins loaded by
FOXSCAPE.  Each default subskin will be in the format depicted below.

/* -import url("ADDRESS"); */ /* -------------------------------- DEFAULT */

These default subskins are not meant to be un-commented.  I changed the "@"
character that should be on the left of "import" to a "-" character to make
the default subskin lines visually stand out from the other subskins and to
serve as a mental reminder to not use these subskins.  These subskins are
here to allow you to see the default settings that FOXSCAPE will have and to
allow you to view the code that produces the named result.  The following
section will describe how to view a subskin's code (content).

A result of my moving all base theme .css file changes to separate subskins
is that it will allow me to produce new versions of FOXSCAPE more easily.
So, this translates into less time for the next major update's release. :-)


Using FOXSCAPE subskins with other themes
-----------------------------------------
All FOXSCAPE subskins that have names that end in "_Fx.css" should work with
themes other than FOXSCAPE.  If you wish to use one of these subskins with
a theme other than FOXSCAPE, you must copy the complete content of the
subskin and paste it into the appropriate user .css file (userContent.css
or userChrome.css).  Alternatively, you could paste it into a file stored
on your hard drive and use it by entering a line into the appropriate user
.css file (userContent.css or userChrome.css) similar to the following:

@import url("file:///c:/FOXSCAPE/include.css");

In that example, the copied content of the subskin is stored in a file
called include.css .  It is stored in a folder called FOXSCAPE in the root
of the C: drive on a Windows based computer.

To see the content of a FOXSCAPE subskin, enter it's address into the
address bar in Firefox while FOXSCAPE is enabled.  Below is an example of
a subskin address from a line in the templates:

A line from the templates:

/* @import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/SUBSKIN-NAME.CSS"); */

The subskin address from the template line above:

chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/SUBSKIN-NAME.CSS


My preset templates
-------------------
In addition to the templates mentioned above, I have also included the
two templates that I am presently using in my installation of FOXSCAPE.

These will allow you to get a taste of what can be done with the included
subskins.  You can use my preset templates by simply adding one line to
two files.

1. Copy the following line and insert it at the top of userChrome.css

@import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/0-MyUserChrome.css");

2. Copy the following line and append it at the end of userContent.css

@import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/0-MyUserContent.css");

After saving your changes, restart Firefox to make my preset templates
active.

You may view the content of my two templates by entering the following
addresses into the address bar and pressing enter:

 chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/0-MyUserChrome.css

 chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/0-MyUserContent.css

You will then be able to see which subskins have been enabled.  You can
also use these two addresses in place of the following address

 chrome://browser/skin/config
 
in the steps described at the beginning of the Advanced Customization
section.  You will then be able to alter my settings to your liking.


The profile-directory/chrome/ folder
------------------------------------
The userContent.css and userChrome.css files mentioned in this readme
file are located in the chrome folder that is stored in the 
profile-directory folder.  The profile-directory folder will be in a
different place on almost every machine.  The location is affected
by the operating system type and version, as well as user name and
other factors.  So, this makes it difficult to describe the location
in this file.  An example of where you would find the chrome folder
on a Windows XP based computer appears below:

C:\Documents and Settings\[Windows Login Name]\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[Random String].default\chrome\

[Windows Login Name] and [Random String] will vary.

A new feature in Firefox 3.6+ can be used to open the profile directory,
allowing you to simply open the chrome folder that contains the
userContent.css and userChrome.css files mentioned in this readme.

To open the profile directory, go to the about:support address or go
to Help > Troubleshooting Information... on the menu bar.  Once that
page loads, click the Open Containing Folder button under Application
Basics.  Your screen should display a window containing the files that
are in the profile folder on your computer.

Take a look at the following web pages for additional information on
subskins and the location of the profile-directory folder:

 http://ProjectIt.com/subskins.html
 http://Home.Comcast.net/~username54321/starfield/usingsubskins.html
 http://Support.Mozilla.com/kb/Profiles


Un-commenting
-------------
Un-comment lines by removing the leading /* and trailing */ comment
indicators.  You *must* be certain to remove both leading and trailing
comment indicators for a given line or things will not function properly.

When un-commenting lines in the templates, it is recommended that you
replace the leading /* characters with two spaces characters.  That
enables you to easily see which lines are enabled by making them stand
out from the commented lines.  If you decide to disable an enabled line,
just replace the removed /* and */ comment indicators and remove the two
leading space characters if present.

After making comment changes, be sure to restart Firefox to make the
changes active.


Additional Theme Notes
======================

Internal viewable readme
------------------------
This readme file is accessible from Firefox once the FOXSCAPE theme is
installed and activated.  It can be viewed by entering the following
address into the address bar and pressing enter:

 chrome://browser/skin/readme

Once entered, you will be forwarded to the following longer address:

 chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/readme.txt

You will then see this document in the main browser window.

NOTE:
As far as I know, no one has ever provided theme documentation internal to the
theme itself *and* provided an address (like that above) to directly view it.
This manner of providing internal documentation can simply display a text file
or it can be expanded to include HTML and other media files.  The main benefit
of providing internal documentation is lack of need for, or reliance upon,
a web site.  Theme creators who do not have a web site can still provide good
documentation.  Additionally, themes that have their respective web site
disappear incur less damage with respect to their ability to be understood
(configured) by new users.  It is my hope that this technique is embraced by
others and used in their themes.  Theme creators using this technique should
be mindful of not creating bloat by including an excess of media files.
Lastly, if the Firefox developers are listening, please consider the creation
of a standard protocol for developers to follow when providing internal
documentation.  As part of the protocol, there could be a standard URL
provided by Firefox - about:theme - which would link to a specific file path
within the theme.  Alternatively (or additionally), there could be a Readme/
About/Info/Help button made available for each theme in the Tools>Add-ons>
Themes panel.  The benefit of having buttons on each theme is that there
would not be a need to have the theme active to be able to view the
associated documentation.

UPDATE (July 2008):
I recently discovered someone else who has included theme documentation within
themes.  "incognu" has several themes for SeaMonkey (and other browsers) which
have an "about.html" file.  His technique is similar to the one I am using,
though the file name and path in the theme differs from mine.  The address
used in the browser to view his documentation
(chrome://global/skin/about/about.html) also differs from mine.  He does not
presently have any themes for Firefox.  To see his work, visit the following
link: http://incognu.com/themes.xhtml


Internal icon pack
------------------
The internal icon pack can be downloaded and installed by entering the
following address into the address bar and pressing enter or clicking go:

 chrome://browser/skin/iconpack

Follow the instructions that appear on that web page.


Included throbbers
------------------
Below are the descriptions of, and subskin entries for, the throbber files
included in FOXSCAPE.  Refer to the "Advanced Customization" section to
see how to use the subskin entries below.

Netscape N Throbber (From Netscape 4.x - 6.2.3)
/* @import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Throbber_-_force_small_(16x16).css"); */
/* @import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Throbber_-_force_medium_(20x20).css"); */
/* @import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Throbber_-_force_large_(32x32).css"); */
/* @import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Throbber_-_force_extra_large_(40x40).css"); */
/* @import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Throbber_-_auto_small_and_medium.css"); */
/* @import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Throbber_-_auto_small_and_large.css"); */
/* -import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Throbber_-_auto_small,_large_and_extra_large.css"); */ /* ------------------------ DEFAULT */

Mozilla M Throbber (From Mozilla M9 - 1.7.13)
/* @import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Throbber_-_Mozilla_auto_small_and_large.css"); */

SeaMonkey Throbber - .gif (From SeaMonkey 1.x)
/* @import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Throbber_-_SeaMonkey_1.x_auto_small_and_large.css"); */

SeaMonkey Throbber - .png (From SeaMonkey 2.x)
/* @import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Throbber_-_SeaMonkey_2.x_auto_small_and_large.css"); */


Included image files
--------------------
There are five splash/logo files included in the FOXSCAPE theme.
These images may be accessed from a customized about:blank page (also
described in this file) or from extensions, such as the Splash
extension.

There are also six .htm files included to demonstrate the included
images.  You can go to the address of each .htm file to get an idea
of what the images will look like when called from a custom about:blank
page or, to an extent, the Splash extension.

These demonstration .htm files may also be used as your home page by
placing the address of one into the Home Page field in the Main tab on
the Options screen.  When using one as your home page, you can get
almost the same effect as if you had installed the Splash extension or
a custom about:blank page without actually doing so.

There is one extra .htm (0.) file relative to the number of included
image files (five).  This extra .htm file is included to demonstrate
what a custom gray about:blank page (described in this file) will look

Using the Splash! extension
---------------------------
Included in this theme are images which can be used with the "Splash!"
Firefox extension, which is available at the following address:

### NOTE: Unfortunately, this extension has not been updated in quite a
long time and is not able to be used in Firefox 4.0+.  I hope that it,
or a similar extension will be made available to allow for splash screens
in Firefox 4.0+.

 Splash! 2.0.2 (or newer) by mrtech, slyfox
  http://AddOns.Mozilla.org/addon/2995

The recommended settings for "Splash!" are as follows:

 Splash Settings
  General
   [/] Show Splash on Startup
   [ ] Close splash when main window loads
   Auto-close Timeout (1000 = 1 sec): 8000   (Default: 3000)
   Background Color: transparent             (Default: #FFFFFF)
   Window Style: padding: 0px;
  Image
   Image URL (ex: file:///c:/image.png): chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/spl/splash-1.gif    (Default: chrome://branding/content/about.png)
  Text
   [/] Hide splash text completely           (Default: [ ])
   [/] Hide progress meter                   (Default: [ ])
   Override "loading..." text (leave blank for default):
   Text Color: #000000
   Text Style: font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;
  Miscellaneous
   Sound
    [ ] Play sound on startup
    Sound URL (ex: file:///c:/sound.wav):
   Opacity
    [ ] Use Opacity (value range is from 0-1 Ex. '.4')

You can change the "Image URL" to any one of the included image file
addresses described elsewhere in this file.


Custom about:blank page
-----------------------
The Netscape 4.x browsers would start up (if no home page was specified)
with a gray colored page.  When new windows were created they also
appeared with a gray colored page.  Even though there was no formally
defined about:blank page in Netscape, the about:blank page is the
Firefox equivalent to Netscape's initial gray page.

If you would like to make Firefox's about:blank page appear like the
gray page in Netscape, either add the following line of text to the
bottom of your chrome\userContent.css file or un-comment the existing
line in your chrome\userContent.css file.  See the Advanced Customization
section for details.

@import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Gray_about_blank_Fx.css");

Alternatively, you might want to include an image in the center of the
about:blank page to give your empty about:blank page a bit of style.
I have provided an example of a customized about:blank page that displays
a FOXSCAPE splash image that disappears after 5 seconds and leaves a
static FOXSCAPE logo.  If you would like to try out this example, either
add the following line of text to the bottom of your
chrome\userContent.css file or un-comment the existing line in your
chrome\userContent.css file.  See the Advanced Customization section for
details.

@import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Gray_about_blank_with_splash-3.css");

If you would like to create a customized about:blank page with a different
image than the one in my example, you can extract the complete content
of the subskin example above and place it at the bottom of your
chrome\userContent.css file, as described in the "Using FOXSCAPE subskins
with other themes" section, but in this case use the subskin with FOXSCAPE,
and then you can change the image name in the url("IMAGE_NAME") line in
the extracted subskin content to any one of the included image file
addresses described in the "Included image files" section of this file.
You can even use an image file (.png, .gif, .jpg) located on your hard
drive by using an image name similar to the following example.

url("file:///c:/FOXSCAPE/image.png")

In that example, the image file on your hard drive is stored in a file
called image.png .  It is stored in a folder called FOXSCAPE in the root
of the C: drive.

To clarify, the existing line would be changed from:
    background:-moz-dialog url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/spl/splash-3.gif") no-repeat fixed 50% 50% !important;
to
    background:-moz-dialog url("file:///c:/FOXSCAPE/image.png") no-repeat fixed 50% 50% !important;


Skin the Work Offline extension
-------------------------------
FOXSCAPE includes graphic elements which can be used to skin the
graphic elements in this extension.  This extension can be downloaded
from the following address.

 Work Offline 1.6 (or newer) by ASANO, Naoyuki
  http://AddOns.Mozilla.org/addon/493

If you would like to see the graphic elements that are skinned by
FOXSCAPE in this extension, go to one of the following address from
Firefox after installing and enabling FOXSCAPE.

 chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/img/Offline-Online.png
 chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/img/Offline-Online2.png

The following are the suggested settings for this extension when used
with FOXSCAPE.

 Work Offline Settings
  Statusbar Icon
   (*) Original
   ( ) Thunderbird 1.5 or earlier
   ( ) Thunderbird 2
   ( ) Thunderbird 3
  When Firefox starts up
   (*) Do nothing
   ( ) Force offline mode
   ( ) Force online mode
  Advanced
   [/] Show the offline message on the titlebar
   [ ] Reload all tabs when Firefox goes to online mode

If you would like to skin this extension with FOXSCAPE, either add one
of the following lines of text to the top of your chrome\userChrome.css
file or un-comment one of the existing lines in your
chrome\userChrome.css file.  See the Advanced Customization section for
details.

@import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Skin_the_Work_Offline_extension1.css");
@import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Skin_the_Work_Offline_extension2.css");


Skin the QuickRestart extension
-------------------------------
FOXSCAPE includes graphic elements which can be used to skin the
graphic elements in this extension.  This extension can be downloaded
from the following address.

### NOTE: Unfortunately, this extension has not been updated in quite a
long time and is not able to be used in Firefox 4.0+.  I hope that it
will be updated to work in Firefox 4.0+.  Alternatively, use the
Restartless Restart extension. See the link in the Other Firefox
extensions section below.

 QuickRestart 1.1.6 (or newer) by Juan Carlos Avila B.
  http://AddOns.Mozilla.org/addon/3559

If you would like to see the graphic elements that are skinned by
FOXSCAPE in this extension, go to the following addresses from Firefox
after installing and enabling FOXSCAPE.

 chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/img/Restart.png
 chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/img/Restart-small.png

If you would like to skin this extension with FOXSCAPE, either add the
following line of text to the top of your chrome\userChrome.css file
or un-comment the existing line in your chrome\userChrome.css file.
See the Advanced Customization section for details.

@import url("chrome://browser/skin/foxscape/sub/Skin_the_QuickRestart_extension.css");

Note: You need to perform step one in the "Customization - Position the
throbber" section of this readme and drag the Restart button to a toolbar
to see this skin take effect on the QuickRestart extension.

To Do
=====

- Update FOXSCAPE to support new versions of Firefox.
- *Possibly* add icons to the following areas:
  Tools/Add-ons/Get-Add-ons
  Tools/Add-ons/Extensions
  Tools/Add-ons/Appearance
  Tools/Add-ons/Plugins


Not To Do
=========

- A companion theme for Thunderbird.
